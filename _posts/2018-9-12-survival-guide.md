In the case of an attack, keep two things in mind:

1. Act as if you can't see them. Don't stare or make sudden movements.
2. Don't touch the dogs. Don't let them touch your bare skin.

When you spot a pack, following these rules may lead you to the best case scenario, which is remaining alive.

If you're already surrounded, your best option is to cover yourself with cloth or other material and escape. Vantablacks will not attempt to uncover you. If escape is impossible, hiding until they disappear may work, although this is an untested hypothesis. If you know a seer, messaging them your location will have them come to you as soon as possible. If worse comes to worst, this information may help others around the area.
