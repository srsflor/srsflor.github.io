Alternatively known as "wolves", "black dogs", "monsters". "Vantablack" was a term coined by V. F. Seong to name the completely light-absorbing canine creatures.

They move in packs of 3 to 30, possibly more. Disappearing and appearing seemingly on a whim, they appear near those who have seen images of a wild, overgrown forest with flowers of an uncountable number of petals, the deserted ruins of a desert citadel with intricate markings and designs, or a dark wooden castle lined with marble and gold.

When they decide to attack, they slowly surround a target until the target initiates contact. Doing so will freeze the target and unless they're pulled away by an outside force, they will start to degrade. A victim's body turns dry and brittle and starts to crumble into fine, traceless particles. 

Survivors of this attack describe a transfer of information. They see these other worlds and begin to learn about different rules. Among these survivors, a woman named C. Robinson discovered the ability to keep vantablacks at bay by speaking words of a language that doesn't exist. While some survivors live without physical repercussions, others that were rescued late into disintegration end up with damaged limbs or senses. These are currently irreversible.
